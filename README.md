# Obi

Obi is a unified tool to setup and manage projects for multi-environments, wordpress development, and database sync management.

## Useage:

`obi` `[argument]`

or

`obi` `[argument]` `[project_name]` `[environment(s)]`

### Arguments:

`config`: configure obi

`help`: prints usage to the terminal

`mysql`: login local mysql database

`-e`: Create an empty working directory *(Followed by the `[project_name]`)*

`-g`: Create a git repository working directory *(Followed by the `[project_name]`)*

`-w`: Create a wordpress enabled git working directory *(Followed by the `[project_name]`)*

`-b`: Backup mysql database *(Followed by the `[project_name]` and then the `[environment(s)]`)*

### Project name:

Name of the directory that contains your project.

### Environments:

`-l`: local

`-s`: staging

`-p`: production

`-lts`: local to staging

`-ltp`: local to production

`-stl`: staging to local

`-stp`: staging to production

`-ptl`: production to local

`-pts`: production to staging

## Configuration

When the command `obi`... is ran for the first time, a hidden file is instantly generated in your home directory with the name .obiconfig. **Please do not edit this file directly.** This file is used by obi to store your environment settings that are used when running `obi mysql` and `obi -b project-name`, followed by the `[environment(s)]`.

**To edit this file** simply run the command `obi config`.

The default settings are as follows:

	localprojectdirectory='0'
	localsettings='enabled'
	localhost='localhost'
	localuser='root'
	localpassword='root'

	stagingsettings='disabled'
	stagingdomain='0'
	staginghost='0'
	staginguser='0'
	stagingpassword='0'

	productionsettings='disabled'
	productiondomain='0'
	productionhost='0'
	productionuser='0'
	productionpassword='0'


By default when the file is created it the `localprojectdirectory` is not set and before obi can be used, it needs to be set to your working directory as a direct path without the trailings. The `localsettings` by default are set to enabled and the `stagingsettings` and `productionsetttings` to disabled.

The `localsettings`, `stagingsettings` and `productionsetttings` control how obi will access your MySQL credentials. The three possible settings are:

	enabled
	wp-enabled
	disabled

`enabled`: obi will use the credentials that are set below it.

`wp-enabled`: obi will use the credentials that are on the wp-config.php file.

`disabled`: obi will not use any credentials

## Working Directory

The directory structure below is automatically generated when using the `-e`, `-g` or `-w` arguments, followed by the `project-name`. This way it is very easy to stay organized.

*There are two directories that are essential to obi's functionality. These directories are the dumps and site directories. The dumps directory is used when backing up MySQL databases with the argument `-b`, followed by the `project-name` and then the `[environment(s)]`. Which is then placed its environment folder respectively. The site directory is where WordPress is installed when using the argument `-w` followed by the `project-name`.*

## Database Backups




## Examples:

`obi -e project`: This tells Obi to create an empty working directory named project.

`obi -b -ltp`: This tells Obi to make a backup of local and import it into the production database.
